# Removed unnecessary files and folders to simplify deployment
# Keep only essential files for the Flask app to run:
# - vitalsoft/app.py
# - vitalsoft/__init__.py
# - vitalsoft/templates/ (only required HTML templates)
# - requirements.txt
# - Procfile
# - render.yaml or Dockerfile (depending on deployment method)
# - vitalsoft/models.py (if used by app.py)
# 
# Delete or archive:
# - commit_fix_deploy.txt
# - pythonanywhere_deploy_instructions.txt
# - any other unrelated or backup files
