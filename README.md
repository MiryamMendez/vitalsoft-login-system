# VitalSoft Login System

## Project Overview
The VitalSoft Login System is a web application designed to provide users with a secure login interface. The application is built using Flask and HTML templates for rendering. It focuses on offering an intuitive user experience for users to sign in using their credentials.

## Installation
To set up the VitalSoft Login System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vitalsoft-login.git
   cd vitalsoft-login
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, create a virtual environment and install Flask:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install Flask
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   Set the environment variable for Flask and start the server:
   ```bash
   export FLASK_APP=app.py # On Windows use `set FLASK_APP=app.py`
   flask run
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.

## Usage
Once the server is running, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/login` to access the login interface. Users can enter their usernames and passwords to log in.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure login mechanism for users.
- **Responsive Design:** User-friendly interface that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Error Handling:** Basic validation to ensure users provide credentials.

## Dependencies
The application requires the following Python package for operation:
- Flask: A micro web framework for Python.

If more dependencies are present in your `package.json`, they should be mentioned here. As this project utilizes Flask primarily, the focus is on Python dependencies.

## Project Structure
Here’s a brief overview of the project structure:

```
vitalsoft-login/
│
├── login.html          # HTML template for the login page.
├── base.html           # Base HTML template that might be extended by other templates.
├── app.py              # Main application file for initializing Flask and routes.
└── venv/               # Virtual environment directory (created during installation).
```

This structure ensures modularity and separation of concerns, enabling easier maintenance and scalability of the application.
